      <p class="lead">
        Protection for your business premises, equipment, stock and liability towards customers, partners and staff.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2 class="h2">Premises &amp; Equipment</h2>
      <p>
        The foundation of business insurance is protecting your physical premises and company assets: building,
        permanent installations, machinery, professional equipment, computers, stock and storage areas. We design the
        coverage together so that one major claim does not turn into a financial disaster.
      </p>
      <p>Typical covers include fire, explosion, storm, flood, water leaks, burglary, theft and malicious damage.</p>
      <p>
        We take into account whether the building is owned or rented, the year and type of construction and the real
        replacement value of the building and contents.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2 class="h2">Public &amp; Employers’ Liability</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond material damage, a key risk for any business is compensation claims from third parties. Public liability
        insurance covers bodily injury or property damage caused to customers, visitors or neighbours as a result of
        your business activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Employers’ liability covers claims from employees for accidents that occur during or in connection with their
        work. In technical trades and field-based operations this cover is essentially a must.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2 class="h2">Business Interruption</h2>
      <p>
        A serious loss does not only cost money in repairs; it also affects your turnover and profit. Business
        interruption cover can provide financial breathing space while you get back to normal operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        It can help cover fixed expenses such as rent, salaries and running costs, and replace part of the net profit
        you would otherwise lose because of an insured event.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2 class="h2">Process &amp; Quote</h2>
      <p>
        To make sure you do not just buy “a policy” but real protection, we follow a clear process. First we record your
        business profile: activity, size (turnover, number of employees), description of premises and equipment. Then we
        analyse the main risks for your sector and how much loss you could realistically absorb yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on this, we request targeted offers from several insurers and compare limits, exclusions, deductibles and
        total cost. You receive a written summary of the options in simple language and choose the solution that fits
        your needs and budget, without pressure.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h3">What we need to prepare a business insurance quote</h3>
      <p>
        To prepare a serious and realistic quote we usually need: company details (name, VAT number, address and legal
        form), a clear description of your activity and any secondary activities, basic information about the premises
        (owned or rented, size, floor, value of building and contents), approximate annual turnover, number of
        employees and any significant past claims.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can send this information through the contact form or provide it step by step by talking to our digital
        assistant. For any questions about your business insurance, please consult our digital assistant before you
        decide.
