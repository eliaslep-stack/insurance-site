      <h2 class="h2">Third Party and Extended Covers</h2>
      <p>
        We start from the legal minimum and add fire, theft, natural perils and other extensions only where they make sense for the value and use of the vehicle.

    <section class="card">
      <h2 class="h2">Comprehensive and Driver Cover</h2>
      <p>
        Comprehensive cover protects your own car after an at fault accident.
        Driver personal accident covers you as a person, not only the vehicle, and is particularly important in Greece where many drivers are under-insured.

    <section class="card">
      <h2 class="h2">Roadside Assistance and Glass Cover</h2>
      <p>
        Roadside assistance and towing, as well as glass cover, are often low cost compared to the benefit they offer.
        We check whether they are included in the base plan or need to be added separately.

      <h2 class="h2">Claims Support</h2>
      <p>
        In case of an accident you contact me directly or the assistance line of the insurer.
        I help you collect documents, communicate with the repair shop and follow up the claim until payment or completion of repairs.
